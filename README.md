Boonleng's Shell Script Library
===============================

Over the years, I have written some functions to help making coding easier. I have used to in many servers so I thought it might be a good idea to collect these functions into a big script so I can just source this and have all the functions available without a bunch of copy and paste.


boonlib.sh
----------
A bunch of convenient functions


mount_anastasia.sh
------------------
This script uses `sshfs` to mount a LAN machine that can be reached with .local addressing. Example usage is `mount_anastasia.sh deepsky` to mount the root drive with partition name `deepsky` of the machine `deepsky.local`. This naming scheme is what I usually practice. Why Anastasia? Anastasia is the main host of PX-10,000 which I use SSHFS the most.


tconfig.sh
----------
A collection of SSH tunnel set up parameters for pulling reverse tunnel connections that have been established through starbuck.nwc.ou.edu or any servers.


wake.sh
-------
Wake up a machine in LAN.


rmtags.sh
---------
A command line to remove extra attributes, which can be seen using `ls -l@`. Some annoying tags like com.apple.quarantine will be removed using this utility.


ncdc.sh
-------
A script to use `wget` to download all the `.tgz` files in a URL. This was specifically developed for downloading multiple Level-II files from an NCDC download link.
