Boonleng's Shell Script Library
===============================

Over the years, I have written some functions to help making coding easier. I have used to in many servers so I thought it might be a good idea to collect these functions into a big script so I can just source this and have all the functions available without a bunch of copy and paste.


boonlib.sh
----------
A bunch of convenient functions


tconfig.sh
----------
A collection of SSH tunnel set up parameters for pulling reverse tunnel connections that have been established through starbuck.nwc.ou.edu or any servers.
